# Clearify Open Badge Diploma
## Who is the issuer of a language certificate?
- head of the university’s department to which the language course belongs (person’s name) 
- not multiple issuers
## What exactly for a badge is put into a backpack? What kind of file is it?
1.	Badge image: upload badge directly. Use the drag and drop feature or the file picker to select the badge. Open Badges only use .PNG or .SVG file types, because these types contain the badge's metadata
-> When downloading now a moodle badge, the specific metadata are not included -> this way doesn’t work now with a downloaded moodle badge!

2.	Paste badge URL: Sometimes, a badge doesn't have an image associated with it, or is otherwise not downloaded, and can be added to a backpack service by inputting the Assertion URL
->	This way only works, when we have an online moodle account! We don’t have one!

3.	JSON: When viewing your badge, there may be a View JSON button. You can select it, then select Copy to clipboard. When uploading your badge, select the Advanced tab and paste the badge's JSON into the dialog box for easy upload.
->	We focus on this way!!!
