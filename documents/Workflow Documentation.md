# Workflow Documentation
The first thing we did was look at the student ID architecture. Then we looked at which actors should exist in the SSI Moodle paradigm (issuer, holder, verifier, issuer's SSI agent, verifier's SSI agent) and how the student credential architecture should be extended. We depicted the flow of information in the system or how the actors are connected using activity and sequence diagrams. Furthermore, we looked at what Open Badges, Backpacks, and APIs are. We looked at what W3C EDU VC's look like and how they correlate to normal WRC VCs.
In the next step we installed and started Moodle locally. We created a teacher account (admin) from which we created two courses. The two courses are "English A1" and "French A1" and include various activities like quizzes, chats, or feedback. Furthermore, we have created five sample students who occupy the courses and their activities. The courses also consist of lectures and exercises. For each sampled student who has taken a course or successfully passed a quiz, we have issued a corresponding badge/credential using the teacher account. We examined how such an issued Moodle badge can be mapped to a W3C EDU VC. So that we can exchange ideas with Moodle experts, we have registered in the Moodle Forum.
