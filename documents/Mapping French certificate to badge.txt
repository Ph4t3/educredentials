At the end of the course, students will be able to 	understand and use familiar, everyday expressions and	very simple sentences aimed at satisfying concrete needs. They can introduce themselves and others and ask other people questions about themselves - e.g. where they live, 	people they know and things they own - and can respond to questions of this kind. Students can communicate in a simple way if the person they are talking 	with speak slowly and clearly and is willing to help. (Source: Global	Scale CEFR)
	The course is based on the textbook: Défi 1 (A1) Livre de l'élève + CD and Défi 1 (A1) 
	Cahier d'exercices + MP3 téléchargeables
	Methodology: Language skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking) are taught according to the action-oriented approach, i.e. language use plays an important role in 
	the lessons. Grammar and vocabulary are discussed and explained in context. 
	ECTS and Workload: The course is credited by the Council the Faculty of Humanities at	TU Berlin with 6 ECTS. This corresponds to a workload of 180 hours.
	Attendance: Students are required to fulfil a minimum of 80% of the online tasks in order to be allowed to take the end-of-tern exam.
	Exam form: The end-of-term exam consists of four parts representing each 25% of the final grade (listening comprehension, reading comprehension, oral competence, written 
	competence). Students can achieve 100 points (100%).
